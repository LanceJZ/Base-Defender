# Base-Defender
Version A00001.1 side scrolling arcade game with castle defence atributes.

A minimal functioning version of the game. Only graphic place holders will be used until all functionality is complete.
Visual Studio 2013 was used to make this project.
This game requires the latest version of the SFML library.

The Entity class controls and makes the sprite setup easy and is made to be used with any game.
The ResourceHolder.hpp is an open source file that stores all the textures for game use, so they are loaded once, and kept as a pointer.
Sprite animation will be added in a future version, likily after all game functionality is complete.

This is a remake of a game by the same name that I created using XNA years ago. This time it can be easily ported to both Linux and Android.
