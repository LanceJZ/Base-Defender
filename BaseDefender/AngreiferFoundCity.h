//This class is a mode for this ship type that moves it to the city that was assigned to it, spawned to do one thing. 
//When it moves to its city, just over the top, IPTB becomes true telling
//the enemy spawn class to disable it, and spawn the city bomber mode in its place.
//Separating every mode will make the code easier to maintain.
