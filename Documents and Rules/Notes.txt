From Original XNA Game.
I've added the workings of the shield and armor modifier. My Task list vanished, so I added a TODO list text file. Though I'm going to use
comment // TODO: in my code, as it shows up in the task comments list. I think you can add words to its watch list.
Added in BaseRepair.
Added base shield, using a very temp texture. Added sprite list for shield, made it invisible, added it to the destroy method.
Added base shield damage, and base wont take damage if it has shields. Added method to add shields to base.
I could add graphics for when an Attacker attacks a base.
Added Drone, Drone targeting system, and fire solution. Found function on the web to use for getting angle to fire. It took me all day to get
 that worked out (6 hours).
I may add experience points for evading Falcon Missiles.
On Base Target, have it set a random angle until it reaches its bounds, then set another random angle.
By wave 6, one should have about 1000 Exp if they are doing well. At this time the game gets pretty hard. By wave 5 it gets difficult.
I will have drone become available at Level 2, at 500 exp, for 500 credits.
Every boss ship will have one unique weapon type.

Make new enemy like Agis Wing enemy that turns into a kamakazy ship if the player gets near it. Could just make Seeker behave like that.
Make it a Kamikaze ship!
